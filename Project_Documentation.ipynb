    "Higher rates of hate crimes are closely linked to greater income inequality in a society. When the gap between the wealthy and the poor widens, economic frustration and social division tend to intensify. People who feel left behind economically may channel their resentment toward marginalized groups, which can fuel prejudice and, in some cases, escalate into hate-motivated offenses. This is not just about money, it is about how inequality erodes trust, weakens social bonds, and amplifies ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù thinking. For example, studies in both the United States and Europe have found that regions with higher income inequality often report more racially or religiously motivated attacks, even when other factors like overall crime rates are accounted for. Economic distress can become a spark for scapegoating minorities. Imagine two towns: one where most residents enjoy a stable middle-class life, and another where wealth is concentrated among a few while many struggle to meet basic needs. In the second ,town resentment brews, narratives of blame take root, and tensions simmer, making acts of targeted hostility far more likely.\n",
